This tiny program is a watchdog for websites that will post the results to AWS CloudWatch
for monitoring and alarms.  This assumes that you already have servers on AWS EC2, and you 
are running websites that are available and containing something constant that can be matched.

To run this watchdog program you'll need to:
    1. Set up AWS CloudWatch
    2. Install python boto, which is widely available
    3. Create an account with access to CloudWatch (preferably limited ONLY to CloudWatch)
    4. Get a list of your servers (e.g. ec2-describe-instances | grep TAG | cut -f 3,5 -s )
    5. For each server, find a stable URL and grab a small snippet of that page
    6. Configure each of the constant elements below
    7. Run the program and see if it is posting correctly to CloudWatch
    8. Monitor the log file if needed (e.g. tail -f /var/log/httpd/website_watchdog.log)
    9. If all is good, set up any alarms in CloudWatch for these custom metrics

Best of luck!
